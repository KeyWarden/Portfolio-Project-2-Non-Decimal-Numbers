# Non Decimal Number Systems

It is primarily targeted towards teens and adults, and is focused on prociding a summary of the basics behind both base number systems as a concept, and binary and hexadecimal in specific.

Given that the most important information is the summary itself, as well as the decription of how to read and understand non decimal number systems, that information is provided on the home page, alongside some interesting trivia on an unusual type of base number system, as well as buttons to navigate to the quiz and the page of sources for information.
